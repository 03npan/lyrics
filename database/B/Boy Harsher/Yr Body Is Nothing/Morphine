I

I

I wanna take you down
Lies make it hurt
You, you want the same thing
I wanna make it sting

Alone in my hotel room
Alone without a second chance
I wanna make it hurt more
I wanna make you dance
It's like heaven above
It's like heaven above

She's like morphine on my mind
She's like morphine all the time
She's like morphine when I'm coming down
She's like morphine when I hit the ground
She's like morphine

I

She's like morphine on my mind
She's like morphine in my way

You
You
You

Lies will make it hurt
Lies will make it hurt

You want the same thing
It's like heaven above
I'm in heaven above
